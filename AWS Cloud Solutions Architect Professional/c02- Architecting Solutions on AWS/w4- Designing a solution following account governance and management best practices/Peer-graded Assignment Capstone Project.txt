For this solution, I would recommend a decoupled architecture that takes advantage of AWS managed services to minimize the operational overhead of hosting the application and the data analytics workload in the cloud.

Architecture:

AWS Architecture Diagram

Frontend:

For the frontend layer, I would recommend using Amazon S3 to host the static content and Amazon CloudFront as a content delivery network to improve performance and scalability.

Backend:

For the backend layer, I would recommend using AWS Lambda, Amazon API Gateway, and AWS Step Functions to build serverless microservices that can be easily scaled and managed. You can leverage Step Functions for orchestration of the backend workflows, Lambda to execute the individual functions, and API Gateway to create a RESTful API to expose these functions. This would help to decouple the backend from the frontend, enabling each layer to be scaled independently. For the database layer, I would recommend using Amazon Aurora Serverless for a fully managed and scalable relational database service that can scale based on the application's demand.

Data Analytics:

For the data analytics workload, I would recommend using Amazon S3 for storing the data, and AWS Glue for data ingestion and processing. AWS Glue is a fully managed extract, transform, and load (ETL) service that can discover and extract data from various sources, transform it into a usable format, and load it into data stores. Once data is loaded into S3, you can use Amazon EMR to run Hadoop and Spark jobs for data processing and analytics. For data visualization, I would recommend using Amazon QuickSight, a fully managed business intelligence service that can be used to create and publish interactive dashboards that can derive insights from the data.

Why these services?

S3: S3 provides durable, secure, and scalable object storage, which is an ideal solution for storing static website content and data.
CloudFront: CloudFront is a global content delivery network that can improve performance and reduce latency for the frontend layer.
Lambda: Lambda provides a fully managed, event-driven computing service that can execute code in response to triggers, enabling rapid development of backend services with minimal overhead.
API Gateway: API Gateway provides a fully managed service that can be used to create, deploy, and manage APIs, allowing for easy integration of the frontend with the backend.
Step Functions: Step Functions provides a fully managed service that can be used to build serverless workflows, providing orchestration of the backend workflows.
Aurora Serverless: Aurora Serverless provides a fully managed, scalable relational database service that can automatically scale based on the application's demand.
Glue: Glue is a fully managed, serverless ETL service that can be used for data ingestion, processing, and transformation.
EMR: EMR provides a fully managed service that can run Hadoop and Spark jobs, enabling data processing and analytics.
QuickSight: QuickSight provides a fully managed business intelligence service that can be used to create and publish interactive dashboards that can derive insights from the data.
This architecture provides a decoupled solution that can scale based on demand and requires minimal operational overhead. The services used are all managed services, which means they can be deployed rapidly and with minimal management overhead, allowing teams to focus on delivering business value. The use of Lambda and API Gateway for the backend enables the creation of serverless microservices that can scale independently of the frontend and database layers, while the use of Aurora Serverless enables the database layer to scale based on demand. The use of Glue and EMR provides a scalable solution for data processing and analytics, while QuickSight provides a fully managed business intelligence service for data visualization.
